## DropDown

1. DropDown with Open:
 <br>**Syntax**
 ```
 <details open>
 <summary>Want to know more? </summary>
 <br>
 This is called a DropDown.
 <br>Yes! This is possible using Markdown.
 <br>You can hide some content from the user.
 <br>They can view the detailed message only when they click.
 </details>
 ```
 **Output**
 <details open>
 <summary>Want to know more?</summary>
 <br>
 This is called a DropDown.
 <br>Yes! This is possible using Markdown.
 <br>You can hide some content from the user.
 <br>They can view the detailed message only when they click.
 </details>

 **Explanation**
 <br>The *details* tags are used to indicate that we want a dropdown.
 <br>The keyword *open* in details tag is causing the dropdown to stay opened even before the user clicks on it, which messes up the fun!
 <br>It looks like a question and answer - this is not our purpose, we fix this in the below example.
 <br>Between the *summary* tags, we write the heading/content to be displayed.
 <br>After *summary*, we can include the detailed content.
 <br>However, when a user clicks on the arrow, the detailed content gets hidden; with another the click, the content is displayed again.

2. DropDown without Open:
 <br>**Syntax**
 ```
 <details>
 <summary>Want to know more? Click Here</summary>
 <br>
 This is called a DropDown.
 <br>Yes! This is possible using Markdown.
 <br>You can hide some content from the user.
 <br>They can view the detailed message only when they click.
 </details>
 ```
 **Output**
 <details>
 <summary>Want to know more? Click Here</summary>
 <br>
 This is called a DropDown.
 <br>Yes! This is possible using Markdown.
 <br>You can hide some content from the user.
 <br>They can view the detailed message only when they click.
 </details>

 **Explanation**
 <br>The *details* tags are used to indicate that we want a dropdown.
 <br>This is what we require, the detailed content should be hidden initially. With a click, the information should be displayed.
 <br>Between the *summary* tags, we write the heading/content to be displayed inside or what we refer to as **DROPDOWN TITLE**.
 <br>After *summary*, we can include the detailed content, this will be shown only when the user clicks the dropdown title.

            D-->E;
```

## FootNote

**Explanation:**
<br>Footnotes allow you to add notes and references without cluttering the body of the document. 
<br>When you create a footnote, a superscript number with a link appears where you added the footnote reference. 
<br>Readers can click the link to jump to the content of the footnote at the bottom of the page.

**Syntax:**

```
Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

```
**Output:**

Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.


## Comments

**Explanation:**
<br>Comments are text notes added to a program or a document to provide explanatory information.
<br>You can hide content from the rendered Markdown by placing the content in a comment.


**Syntax**

```
This is Line Number 1. 
<!---This is Line Number 2 and would not be rendered as this is a comment. --->
This is Line Number 3.
```

**Output**

This is Line Number 1. 
<!---This is Line Number 2 and would not be rendered as this is a comment. --->
This is Line Number 3.
